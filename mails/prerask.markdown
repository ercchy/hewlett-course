#Dear MOOCians,

We are now a week away from the start of the class, which begins April 13th. I’ve got some warm-ups for you:

Your Tasks:

* Read the Getting Started PDF ( http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-189-a-gentle-introduction-to-programming-using-python-january-iap-2011/lectures/MIT6_189IAP11_start.pdf )  from 6.189 A Gentle Introduction to Python

* Install Python ( http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.6.8/ ) 


>Please note:

>The Python environment IDLE can be a little disorienting to some users. It has two distinct windows, an “interpreter” window, which has prompts (&gt;&gt;&gt;) and immediately executes commands, and a “program” window, in which you write and save multiple line programs. Save yourself many bangs of your head on your desk by reviewing the this [document]( https://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/%7Edyoo/python/idle_intro/index.html
 ). 


Follow those directions, and in no time, you’ll be flying!
