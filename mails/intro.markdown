#Welcome to gentle introduction to programming using Python

Hi, this is me: 

![Image of robot called Mooc-E](../img/mooc-e.jpg)

I am so happy to meet you! My name is Mooc-e amd I will be your kind guide trough this experience of learning about programming. I think you are amazing for showing up and I would really like to get to know you. 

Trough out the course I will mainly hang out [here](http://discourse.p2pu.org/c/gentle-introduction-to-python), so please come by and say Hi. Tell me about yourself who you are and what you do, what or who is it that brought you my way? I want to learn all about you. Don't leave me hanging, I am excited to meet you and introduce you to others.

#What is this course all about?

This course will provide a comprehensive fast-paced introduction to programing and during this course we will be using Python programing language. Yes, Python is a snake, but this is a good kind of snake, promise.

The course is suitable for __everyone__ who wants to learn about programing. So if you have little or no prior experience with programing, and you are highly motivated to learn it, we will have lots of fun together.

## How it works?

Beginning April 13th, once a week, I will send an assignment message to your inbox. Each message will reveal great resources that exist on the open web. No new content is being created for this experiment–rather, I will be combining open materials to make relevant packages just for you.

This is an experiment–the content from the different tools may sometimes not sync up exactly. I encourage to you explore the resources I give you, and the open web. It is a fun place!

In each message, I will signal your attention toward some combination of:

* Selected readings from the course text, [__How to Think Like a Computer Scientist__]( http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkCSpy/html/ ) 
	
* Exercises from Codecademy ( http://www.codecademy.com/#!/exercises/0 ) 

* Homework sets from 6.189 A Gentle Introduction to Programming Using Python ( http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-189-a-gentle-introduction-to-programming-using-python-january-iap-2011/ ) 

And you always want to come to:
[P2PU's forum](http://discourse.p2pu.org/c/gentle-introduction-to-python), where you will meet me and  other students and will be able to get help. Of course I also strongly encourage you to log in and check if there is anyone that would need help with something and you can provide it. We all know that knowledge gained by explaining is much deeper, thus much more rewarding. 
So if you have questions, are struggling or just want to chat with other folks, (this)[http://discourse.p2pu.org/c/gentle-introduction-to-python] is the right place for you to do so.

I will present the materials in a recommended order, but really you can attack them in whatever order you prefer–though it will almost always make sense to do the homework last.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Important: I will not grade homework (happy times). In most cases you can check your own work using the Python interpreter (If you don't know what that is, don't worry, when we start this is going to be something you will learn about). If you get stuck or can’t come up with a correct answer, ask for help on (P2PU forum)[http://discourse.p2pu.org/c/gentle-introduction-to-python]. Remember, the goal here is to become a great programmer, not to submit a bunch of correct answers.



#What Will We Be Using?

##Introducing MIT OpenCourseWare.

For ten years, [MIT OpenCourseWare]( http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm ) has published MIT’s core academic materials-syllabi, lecture notes, assignments and exams-freely and openly on the web for anyone to learn from. Learn they have: with more than 170 million people viewing OCW materials since the site’s launch, it’s clear there’s a whole lot of learning going on. And since it’s what the MIT students get, you know it’s got to be good.

OCW has more than 2,180 courses, so have a good look around, but for purposes of this class we’ll only be using one:

6.189 A Gentle Introduction to Python ( http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-189-a-gentle-introduction-to-programming-using-python-january-iap-2011/ )  – A three week course offered at MIT. This course will provide the basic structure of the Mechanical MOOC course, though we’ll take six weeks to do it. After all, why hurry? We’ll use the text, handouts and homework assignments.

Keep in mind: These materials are published just the way MIT students got them, so they may contain class instructions that don’t apply to the Mechanical MOOC course; if you get confused, follow the information in the e-mails or ask for help.

##Introducing Codecademy

Learning a coding language can be a little intimidating, especially if you’ve never programmed before. There’s special software to download and learn and you need to understand a bit more about how a computer works than the average user. When you’re just getting started, it would be great if you could just ignore all of that and just focus on the basics. With Codecademy ( http://www.codecademy.com/#!/exercises/0 ) , you can. The site provides great exercises for learning Python, Javascript, jQuery, HTML, CSS and lots of other things you may not have heard of–and they all run in your browser without any download or set up. Pretty slick.

###What will we be using?

Their [Python exercises](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python) , of course.

Something to remember.

Codecademy Python exercises are written in Python 2.7, and the rest of the class uses 2.6. The differences should not for the most part affect the class, but you can see what’s different here ( http://docs.python.org/whatsnew/2.7.html ) .


#What I Do If I Encounter a Problem?

I encourage you to see problems as learning opportunities. To wit:

* If there’s a technical problem with the site, drop me a note at the forum or email me at [mooc-e@p2pu.org]( mailto:mooc-e@p2pu.org ) .
* If you’re stuck and want a quick question answered, consult (P2PU's forums)[http://discourse.p2pu.org/c/gentle-introduction-to-python].
* If you’re looking to discuss problems or work through them with other people, think about forming for a small group in your local community by finding people that are as motivated as you are to study with you. 


Soon, young MOOCians, this shall be you:

Mechanical MOOC thanks you for your valor thus far,

– MM





##When Do We Start?

The course begins April 13th, so MOOC-E asks you to kindly start your engines.
