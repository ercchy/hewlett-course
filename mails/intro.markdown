#Hey there, welcome to gentle introduction to programming using Python

Hi, this is me: 

![Image of robot called Mooc-E](../img/mooc-e.jpg)

I am so happy to meet you! My name is MOOC-E and I will be your kind guide trough this experience of learning about programming. I think you are amazing for showing up and I would really like to get to know you. 

How, you ask? Trough out the course I will hang out [here](http://discourse.p2pu.org/c/gentle-introduction-to-python), so please come by and say *hi*. Tell me about yourself who you are and what you do, what or who is it that brought you my way? I want to learn all about you. Don't leave me hanging, I am excited to meet you and introduce you to others.

#What is this course all about?

This course will provide a comprehensive __fast-paced__ introduction to programing. During this course we will be using Python programing language. Yes, Python is a snake, I know, but this is a good kind of snake, 
promise! <3

The course is suitable for __everyone__ who wants to learn about programing. So if you have little or no prior experience with programing, and you are highly motivated to learn it, we will have lots of fun together.

## How it works?

Beginning April 13th, once a week, I will send an assignment message to your inbox. Each message will reveal great resources that exist on the open web. No new content is being created for this experiment–rather, I will be combining open materials to make relevant packages just for you.

This is an experiment–the content from the different tools may sometimes not sync up exactly. I encourage to you explore the resources I give you, and the open web. It is a fun place!

In each message, I will signal your attention toward some combination of:

* Selected readings from the course text, [__How to Think Like a Computer Scientist__]( http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkCSpy/html/ ) 
	
* Exercises from Codecademy ( http://www.codecademy.com/#!/exercises/0 ) 

* Homework sets from 6.189 A Gentle Introduction to Programming Using Python ( http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-189-a-gentle-introduction-to-programming-using-python-january-iap-2011/ ) 

And you always want to come to:
[P2PU's forum](http://discourse.p2pu.org/c/gentle-introduction-to-python), where you will meet me and  other learners and will be able to get help. Of course I also strongly encourage you to log in and check if there is anyone that would need help with something and you can provide it. We all know that knowledge gained by explaining is much deeper, thus much more rewarding. 
So if you have questions, are struggling or just want to chat with other folks, (this)[http://discourse.p2pu.org/c/gentle-introduction-to-python] is the right place for you to do so.

I will present the materials in a recommended order, but really you can attack them in whatever order you prefer–though it will almost always make sense to do the homework last.

> Important: I will not grade homework (happy times). In most cases you can check your own work using the Python interpreter (If you don't know what that is, don't worry, when we start this is going to be something you will learn about). If you get stuck or can’t come up with a correct answer, ask for help on (P2PU forum)[http://discourse.p2pu.org/c/gentle-introduction-to-python]. Remember, the goal here is to become a great programmer, not to submit a bunch of correct answers.


#When Do We Start?

The course begins April 13th, so MOOC-E asks you to kindly start your engines.


Soon, my young knowledge wells, this shall be you:

My robotic heart thanks you for your valor thus far,
